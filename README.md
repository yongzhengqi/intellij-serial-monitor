# Serial Monitor plugin for IntelliJ IDEA Platform #
This plugin aims to leverage Arduino development with CLion by providing Serial Monitor Tool Window. It allows you to communicate to your Arduino device without leaving the IDE. Functionality is pretty similar to those, available in Arduino IDE through "Serial Monitor Tool".
**Note:** Only COM port (both hardware and virtual) is currently supported. In order to use virtual COM port please make sure to install all necessary drivers.

## Features ##
- Serial Monitor Tool Window with project-based persistent settings
- Status widget
- Duplex Console View (Regular view + HEX)

## Troubleshooting ##

On Linux you may not see you port in available ports dropdown due to lack or permissions.

- To check, that serial port is really there use ```dmesg | grep tty```
- To set read and write permission to port, use ```sudo chmod a+rw <your_port_name>```, where **your_port_name** should
be something similar to _/dev/ttyACM0_, use the output of the above command to check the exact name.
